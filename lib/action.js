 * needs to be sent to the client. There are three cases:
 *
 * 1.  The action didn't return anything.  In this case we assume the action
 *     took care of sending its response itself.
 * 2.  The action returned an object that is an instance of HTTPResponse, aka it
 *     returned a prebuilt response with a `respond()` function. so just call
 *     `respond()` on that object.
 * 3.  The action returned something else.  In this case we want to send this to
 *     the client.  If it is a string, send it as it is, and if it is anything 
 *     else convert it to a JSON string and then send it.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * + `action_response`: the response from the action.
